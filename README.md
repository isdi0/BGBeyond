Boldly Going Beyond (BGB) is a high-performance revision of the To Boldly Go lineage. While most 1.12.2 packs are stuck in the past, BGB utilizes the Cleanroom engine to bring the performance and features of Java 17 to a version originally built to run on Java 8.

## Features

*   **Sci-fi Exploration** - Travel to distant planets and explore strange new worlds with a focus on discovery and exploration; seek out new life and new civilizations, Boldly Going where no Minecraft player has gone before!
*   **Cleanroom powered** - Faster, smoother, and more stable than ever before\[citation needed\]
*   **Increased Depth** \- Subtle shifts toward realism and deeper progression that give new purpose to the Boldly Going experience, with no hand holding from a quest book.
*   **Slim and** **Optimized** \- Not a kitchen-sink pack. Every mod is hand-picked for its contribution to the sci-fi aesthetic and gameplay loop.

### Technical Requirements

**\[IMPORTANT!\]** This pack requires Java 17 or higher (Recommended: 17-21).

OptiFine: Not supported. The pack includes modern optimization mods that conflict with it.

## Legacy

1.  _To Boldly Go 2_ - The original vision by The Beardy Penguin
2.  _Boldly Going 2_ - My previous fork, made so players can continue playing worlds from Beardy's pack.
3.  _Boldly Going Beyond_ - My vision, iterating on Beardy's.
